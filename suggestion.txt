I want to contact you out of freelancer site also.
Do you agree?

my skype id:   live:.cid.ef54329e2aedcf46

I will explain bellow:
Really freelancer don't allow that we communicate out of freelancer.com.
But I want to keep in touch with you always without freelancer because I have to work with you for long time.
So I want to know your email address.
Skype above is a chatting program.
so i wanted to use it for chatting with you.
however, I will discuss in freelancer for projects.
